There are three folders, which include Matlab codes for the study of fault structure inversion.

  1. Code_for_Manuscripts- All codes for evaluating synthetic and real fault structures inversion used in the manuscript.
  
  2. Code_for_uncertainty- All codes for uncertainty assessment of the synthetic models.
  
  3. FaultInvPSO_GUI- All codes for the GUI for estimating any fault structures.
